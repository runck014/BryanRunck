# Personal Website
This is the repo for my personal website. Over a decade ago, I setup a SquareSpace site. It was very easy, but I have largely regretted it as a hosting platform since because of the annual expense, features I don't need nor use, and lack of flexibility. I will be slowly migrating from SquareSpace to my github pages site. This is my second attempt at the migration, so fingers crossed, life won't get in the way of doing the work this time.
